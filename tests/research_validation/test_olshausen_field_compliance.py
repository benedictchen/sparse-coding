Tests for Olshausen & Field (1996) research compliance.

Validates that our implementation matches the original sparse coding paper:
"Emergence of simple-cell receptive field properties by learning a sparse code 
for natural images" by Olshausen & Field (1996)

Key validation points:
1. Objective function formulation
2. Dictionary learning alternation
3. Sparse inference methods (L1 and log prior)
4. Dictionary normalization constraints
5. Convergence properties
